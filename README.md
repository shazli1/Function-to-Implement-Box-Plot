Box Plot Function
=================


Description:
=============
Required to implement a function that takes a vector of numbers as an input and outputs the values needed to plot the boxplot.
Specifically, the function should output the 1st quartile (q1), 2nd quartile (q2), 3rd quartile (q3), the inter-quartile range, a vector containing the outlier points and the vector containing the extreme outlier points as defined in the lecture.
Function is applied to the data given in the file Data1.txt.


Deliverables:
==============
• Python code.
• The values of q1, q2, q3, inter-quartile range, outlier points, and extreme outlier points.
